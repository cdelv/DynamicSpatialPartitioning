# DynamicSpatialPartitioning

This repository implements a very simple usage example of the quadtree and loose/tight double-grid proposed by dragon-space in this fantastic [stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41946007/efficient-and-well-explained-implementation-of-a-quadtree-for-2d-collision-det). This other [GitHub repository](https://github.com/terrybrash/dragon-space/tree/main) compiles the code and posts by dragon-space. 

Besides using dragon-space's code, this repo adds the missing SIMD instructions in the original code as long as utilities for benchmarking it. 

Other Github repositories featuring dragon-space's code:
